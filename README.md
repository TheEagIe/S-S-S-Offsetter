# S-S-S-Offsetter
A spriteSourceSize offsetter program for .json files made with TexturePacker. This code may be used for games like Speedrunners

# How to Use:
Name the json file you wish to change to "original.json"

The first prompt will ask for an x-offset. 
This offset will move your sprite across the x-axis, negative = left, positive = right.

The second prompt will ask for a y-offset. 
This offset will move your sprite across the y-axis, negative = up, positive = down.

Leave blank for no changes

Afterwards, it will create a new file named "animation_atlas_variant.json" with your changes

# Limitations
* Assumes every sprite is of the same size, and location.
* That's about it
